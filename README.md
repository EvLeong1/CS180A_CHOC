## Project Goal
The purpose of this Capstone is to create a dynamic simulation of the rule-based algorithm described by the ATOMAC guidelines. This simulation will enable clinical investigators to assess the sensitivity of key quantitative and qualitative parameters within the guidelines such as Hemoglobin (HB), blood pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR) and other assessments made such as "cold-to-touch." By manipulating these parameters via simulation, a better understanding of extreme values and cut points for hemodynamic stability can be made. These sensitivity assessments can be used to determine quicker which patients need surgery and which can be discharged earlier without intervention.
